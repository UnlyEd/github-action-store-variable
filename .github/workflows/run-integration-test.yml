# Summary:
# Test the GitHub Action using an integration test.
# Makes sure the GitHub Action works properly when running on a clean machine, without building anything (integration test).
# This integration test will break if the Vercel project or deployment are deleted, or if the VERCEl_TOKEN doesn't have access to the deployment url.
#
# See https://github.com/actions/checkout https://github.com/actions/checkout/releases/tag/v2
